== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is this a replacement for WordPress SEO by Yoast or the All in One SEO Pack by Michael Torbert?

No! These plugins are great and I use and recommend using those to everyone that works with WordPress and who are serious about optimizing their SEO.

This plugin does not do a single thing they do, SEO Booster does a lot of things that other SEO tools dont do.

SEO Booster was born in 2008 from another need. The original version was premium and was focused on gathering keyword data and rankings from Google. Back then a lot more information was given by Google about what keywords visitors used to find your website, but often even the actual position on the search result page - SERP for short.

It has been years since Google stopped doing that, and SEO Booster evolved to monitoring vistors from 400+ different sources - giving much more details about how your content is found by people searching online.

Most websites will get over 90% of their search engine traffic from Google, but almost no keyword data.

By listening to many other sources you will get a much better picture of your keyword traffic.

You can use the keywords module to dive in to the keyword data - fast using AJAX so you can navigate without waiting for page to reload.

Over the years SEO Booster grew up and went through many different variations and new features.

= Backlinks =

Not only does SEO Booster listen to visitors from search engines, every time a visitor comes via a link from another website, this is recorded also. The amount of visitors, first visit and so on.

The PRO version actually visits the pages and verifies if the link exists and if so, which anchor text is used, is it an image, is it nofollowed and so on.

To help discover new backlinks quicker, there is also an RSS feed you can subscribe to listing new backlinks as the come in.

= 404 Errors =

Every time a visitor follows a link to your website that does not exist, a 404 Error Page Not Found is displayed. Having any 404 errors on your website gives a bad experience for your visitors and Google is not too happy about those either.

Some times you need to let the page be forgotten by letting it give a 404 error, other times you need to redirect to somewhere else.

This module gives you the list of most visited 404 errors and which you should pay most attention to.

= Forgotten Pages =

Google changes their algorithm regularly, and your competitors are not sitting idly by. By monitoring visitors from search engines, SEO Booster can tell you which pages on your website is no longer getting any traffic.

These pages used to get traffic from search engines, but are now no longer visited.

= Weekly Email Reports =

Get a weekly email report with a summary of new keywords and most popular pages.

= Automatic Tagging =

Automatic tagging links your posts by creating terms and automatically tagging related posts or pages.

- Works with any taxonomy
Choose which taxonomy to use - Taxonomies are created based on different criteria, such as minimum and maximum length of the keyword.

- Works with Custom Post Types - CPT
You can choose which custom post types to link with the taxonomy if it is not already associated.

Options:

- Use any taxonomy.
- Assign all post types to taxonomy.
- Set minimum and maximum length of term to create terms automatically.
- Set a maximum of terms/tags per post.

= Logging Details =
* Turn on detailed logging to get more information shown in the log. On heavily visited sites this can add a lot of details.
* Turn on debugging for helpful information when trying to find a bug.

* Remember, you should noindex all terms and taxonomies in general. Unless you know what your are doing SEO-wise, you may hurt your rankings. Use this to help you interlink and group your content. Works with other plugins and themes - Custom Post Type.

= PRO - Verify backlinks =

Some backlinks are faked, the Pro version visits each page to filter out false links for you.

= PRO - Google PageSpeed Insights =

**Automatic website speed audits with PageSpeed Insights**

Give you an immediate overview of which pages can be improved for better user experience and SEO.

= PRO - Crawler visits =

Discover which pages on your website are crawled.

This module in the PRO version track visits by search engine robots and crawlers, helping you identify which pages are crawled, and which are not regularly visited.

Every visit by a search robot crawler is recorded and this will give you a chance to see which pages are most frequently visited, but also which could need some help getting more attention.

= PRO - Export data =

In the Pro version you can export your backlinks and keywords to .csv to open in a spreadsheet editor or import in to another SEO tool

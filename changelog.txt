All previous backlinks from domains you spefify will be gradually removed by the maintenance routines running in the background.


* NEW: You can now turn on/off automatically adding the list of popular keywords on each post or page. Previously this was either on or off for all pages and posts.

You can check if this is a keyword source and if so send it to us. Once we add the source to the plugin, the next version will automatically adjust the database and move from the Backlinks page to Incoming Keywords.

* UPDATE: Improved inline help. On all admin pages there is a floating button bottom right corner of your window, use this to access the knowledge-base and get direct help.

* UPDATE: Backlinks page - rearranged for more space. Moved screenshot of the backlink to when you hover over the link itself.


* UPDATE: Removed PHP check script - WordPress 5.1 will introduce a PHP version checker, so no need to nag anyone running PHP 5. If you are, you really need to upgrade - please ask your webmaster or hosting company to help you.

* Reworked code and cleaned out hundreds of lines of code no longer needed for the keyword autolink module.

The code handling the keyword to link routine was also optimized to run faster and be more accurate.

The plugin has to handle many different things. Different kinds of page builders, making sure that the links are not injected into existing links or a link in the middle of a headline.

Things like that would look bad and even break your code.
